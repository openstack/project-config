# In general, to add a new channel for an official OpenStack project
# to this file, just add the name to the list in "channels" without
# anything else.  Additional admins or ops can be added as keys under the
# channel name.

# Each channel is a dictionary with a keys as follows
#
# name:
#   (str) unique channel name (no #)
# alumni:
#   (list) list of nicks that should be removed from ChanServ access
# mode:
#   (str) mode mask for mlock.  Note that flags here are enforced, but
#   flags outside the list are left alone.
# *:
#   (list) every other key is assumed to be a key in the "access:"
#   list.  The provided list of nicks will have the levels for that
#   key applied.
#
# NOTE each channel looks up these values in the "global:" list first.
# Channel specific values override the global values.
#
# For example...
#
# channels:
#   - name: foochannel
#     admins:
#     - xyzzy
#     - plugh
#     ops:
#     - gralpy
#   - name: barchannel
#     mode: +baz

# Global definitions
#

# Access levels (map names in this file to chanserv access levels):
access:
  admins: MASTER
  ops: CHANOP

# Define configuration that should apply to all channels.
global:
  # These entries can be removed after the next accessbot run should
  # people desire, but it is also left here as the official OpenStack
  # IRC Wall of Fame! :)
