# In general, to add a new channel for an official OpenStack project
# to this file, just add the name to the list in "channels" without
# anything else.  Projects who wish to maintain full permissions
# outside the "official" infra list can optionally set "mask" to
# "full_mask".

# Each channel is a dictionary with a keys as follows
#
# name:
#   (str) unique channel name (no #)
# alumni:
#   (list) list of nicks that should be removed from ChanServ access
# mask:
#   (str) default mask for users with chanserv access but not
#   otherwise listed in the channel or global config.  Access is
#   limited to the mask but otherwise left alone.
# mode:
#   (str) mode mask for mlock.  Note that flags here are enforced, but
#   flags outside the list are left alone.
# *:
#   (list) every other key is assumed to be a key in the "access:"
#   list.  The provided list of nicks will have the flags for that
#   key applied.
#
# NOTE each channel looks up these values in the "global:" list first.
# Channel specific values override the global values.

#
# Global definitions
#

# To forward unregistered users to a channel with +f you need to be an
# op in that channel.  This pre-joins and ops (via chanserv) in the
# given channels.
