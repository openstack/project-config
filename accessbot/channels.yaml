# In general, to add a new channel for an official OpenStack project
# to this file, just add the name to the list in "channels" without
# anything else.  Stackforge projects can optionally set "mask" to
# "full_mask" to keep full permissions.

# Global definitions
# First set up the access levels (map names in this file to chanserv flags):
access:
  masters: +AFRefiorstv
  status: +Vt
  meetbots: +O
  operators: +Aeforstv
  channel_op_mask: +AOVefortv
  full_mask: +AFORVefiorstv

# Define access that should apply to all channels.  The label 'mask'
# is special: anyone with perms on a channel that isn't otherwise
# listed for the channel or in the global list will have their access
# limited to the mask but otherwise left alone.
