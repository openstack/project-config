      The base job for OpenStack's installation of Zuul.

      All jobs ultimately inherit from this.  It runs a pre-playbook
      which copies all of the job's prepared git repos on to all of
      the nodes in the nodeset.  It runs a post-playbook which copies
      all of the files in the logs/ directory of every node on to the
      logserver.

      It also sets default timeout and nodeset values (which may be
      overidden).

    # change numbers.  We have a plan to do the formatting in the log
    # publishing playbook and pass the information back to zuul.  That
    # will obsolete this.  Also the uuid thing is obviously
    # ridiculous.  That will be fixed too.
