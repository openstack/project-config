      All jobs ultimately inherit from this.  It runs a pre-playbook

      the nodes in the nodeset.  It runs a post-playbook which copies
      all of the files in the logs/ subdirectory of the executor
      work directory to the logserver.

      It also sets default timeout and nodeset values (which may be
      overidden).
