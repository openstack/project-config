If you would like to contribute to the development of OpenDev,
you must follow the steps in this page:

   https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/infra-manual/latest/developers.html

If you already have a good understanding of how the system works and your
accounts are set up, you can skip to the development workflow section
of this documentation to learn how changes to OpenDev should be submitted for
review via the Gerrit tool:

   https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/infra-manual/latest/developers.html#development-workflow

Pull requests submitted through GitHub will be ignored.

Bugs should be filed on StoryBoard, not GitHub:

   https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/731
